# Simulating a new auction system & its revenue.

* We compare the revenues perceived by a firm when offering an auction system with and without the buyersâ€™ option. 
* We considered an English auction which is a dynamic ascending auction. This type of auction may also include a buyer option. The buyers'option consists in giving the possibility to the winner of an auction to buy a number of units that they want at the price of the first auction. 
* We assumed two different distribution laws and it appeared that the log-normal distribution has a better fit compared to Weibull distribution when it comes to revenue simulation.
